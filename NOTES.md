These are my notes!

This project will be a CLI application that allows a user to look at certain products on a fitness supplement website.
I chose this website AlphaFitnessSupplements.com due to it being a website I will be taking over this summer for a friend.

The CLI should start with a welcome message,
"Welcome to Alpha Supplements!"
"What kind of product are you looking for?"
 1. Pre-workout
 2. Protein
 3. etc.

 Upon the first selection. There should be a list of supplements that fit that category, along with prices.

 Pre-workout
 1. Magnitude Mach 50 - $50
 2. Cellucor C4 - $60
 3. Magnitude Supersonic - $45

 'Exit' at anytime will end the CLI, and 'Menu' will take the user back to the initial startup message.

 The goodbye mmessage upon 'Exit' will say,
 "Thank you for shopping Alpha Supplements!"

 Lets get started!
